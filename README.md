# Notifico!

Notifico is an open source ([MIT][]) replacement to the now-defunct
http://cia.vc service with my own little spin on things.

## Development

To get started with local development, you can use the docker-compose file
included with the project. If you have Docker and docker-compose installed, a
simple:

    docker-compose up

Will get you up and running.
