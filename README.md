# Notifico!

Notifico takes webhooks from "Providers" (such as Github, JIRA, Gitlab, etc),
filters them based off some configuration, and sends them along to chat
networks like IRC.

Notifico is permissively licensed under the [MIT][] license, and is trivial
to self-host.

## Development

To get started with local development, you can use the docker-compose file
included with the project. If you have Docker and docker-compose installed, a
simple:

    docker-compose up

Will get you up and running.
